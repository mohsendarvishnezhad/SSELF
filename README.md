# SSELF: Self-Supervised Ensemble Learning Framework for PolSAR Image Classification

This repository contains the implementation of **SSELF**, a novel Self-Supervised Ensemble Learning Framework for polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) image classification using limited labeled training samples.

## üîç Overview

PolSAR image classification with few labeled samples is a challenging task. SSELF addresses this by combining:

- **EfficientNet-B0** as the backbone for deep spatial-polarimetric feature extraction.
- **Self-supervised learning** using a correlation-based objective for robust feature representation.
- **Deep Curriculum Learning (DCL)** to train the network progressively based on patch difficulty estimated via entropy-alpha decomposition.
- **Ensemble Learning (EL)** at feature and view levels to improve classification performance using multi-scale spatial features and multiple polarimetric bands.

## üöÄ Key Features

- Works with **few labeled samples**.
- Extracts discriminative features in a **self-supervised** way.
- Leverages **curriculum learning** to enhance model robustness.
- Improves results using a **two-level ensemble strategy**.

## üìÅ Structure

- `models/`: Network architectures (EfficientNet, DCL, etc.)
- `datasets/`: Preprocessing scripts for PolSAR data
- `training/`: Curriculum learning and self-supervised training logic
- `inference/`: Scripts for evaluation and visualization
